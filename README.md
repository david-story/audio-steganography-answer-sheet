# Audio Steganography
Created By David Story
<br></br>
Version 1.0

<i>Currently Under Construction</i> 

## General
This is a program that can decode information hidden in a 16-bit .wav file.

## Dependencies:
This project was written in Python 3.7, will most likely run on earlier version of Python 3.X
<br></br>
No dependencies, all functions are either called from the Python Standard Library (PSL) or from the support files that I have provided.
Make sure that these files are in your current directory when you are testing your program:
  * AudioParse.py
  * AudioSteganography.py

If you do not, it is possible the support code will not work.

## Installation:
### For Windows Users:
  Via Download Button:
   1) Download from the Github page
   2) Extract to folder of your choice
   3) Direct terminal to that directory and run your Python File
  Via Command Line:

   2) Directo terminal to directory of choice
   3) git clone https://github.com/david-story/Audio-Steganography.git
   4) Begin running / coding

### For Mac/Linux Users:
 Via Terminal:
  1) Enter terminal
  2) CD to directory of your choice
  3) git clone https://github.com/david-story/Audio-Steganography.git
  4) Begin running / coding

### Audio Files
There are two folders that contain audio files that you can test your program with.
They are:
* unaltered_audio
* audio_with_encoded_message

You can test encoding information into the unaltered audio samples. There is a text file that is included in the altered audio folder that details what the output should be of the encoded message.

All audio was acquired from the public domain, from www.archive.org<br></br>
Most of the audio I chose is also avaliable in full-length at: https://archive.org/details/Greatest_Speeches_of_the_20th_Century
