Version 1.0
Written By David Story

Description:
    AudioParse is a simple library that provides a function that can parse the data from the byte string returned from 
    the readframes(n)function for a wave-object. AudioParse takes input as a wave-object, and will return a list of 
    integers representing the audio points from the start of the audio file to the end of the audio file.
